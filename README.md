# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a simple fullstack task management application designed for internal team use. It allows you to create, view, delete, and update the status of tasks through a minimal, modern interface.

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Express, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Express** - Fast, unopinionated web framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

### üê≥ Docker Compose (Recommended)

The **recommended way** to run TaskFlow is using Docker Compose. This method ensures consistent environments across different machines and eliminates dependency conflicts.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10 or higher)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 2.0 or higher)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd taskflow

# Start all services with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# Access the application
# Web App: http://localhost:3001
# API Server: http://localhost:3000
```

**Stopping the application:**
```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (data will be lost)
docker compose down -v
```

**Viewing logs:**
```bash
# View all logs
docker compose logs

# View specific service logs
docker compose logs web
docker compose logs server

# Follow logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f
```

**Rebuilding after changes:**
```bash
# Rebuild and start services
docker compose up -d --build
```

For detailed Docker instructions and advanced configurations, see [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md).

### üíª Local Development

**Note:** Docker Compose is the recommended method for running TaskFlow. Use local development only if you need to modify the code or have specific development requirements.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).



## Project Structure

TaskFlow is structured as a monorepo to keep both the backend and frontend codebases in sync within a single repository. This approach provides several benefits:

‚úÖ Simplified dependency management ‚Äì everything lives under one package.json (or shared tooling when needed)

‚úÖ Easier development workflow ‚Äì no need to switch repos for fullstack work

‚úÖ Consistent tooling ‚Äì shared ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configs, etc.

‚úÖ Better collaboration ‚Äì clearer context when working on features that touch both API and UI

‚úÖ Unified CI/CD pipelines ‚Äì easier to test and deploy both layers together

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start all applications in development mode
- `npm run build`: Build all applications
- `npm run dev:web`: Start only the web application
- `npm run dev:server`: Start only the server
- `npm run check-types`: Check TypeScript types across all apps

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The pipeline includes:

### üîÑ **Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)**
Runs on every push and pull request to `main` and `develop` branches:
- **Type Checking**: Validates TypeScript types across all applications
- **Build Testing**: Ensures all applications build successfully
- **Unit Testing**: Runs server tests with Jest
- **Security Audit**: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies

### üìã **Pull Request Validation (`pr.yml`)**
Provides enhanced validation for pull requests:
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All CI checks plus additional validations
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment for PR changes
- **Docker Validation**: Ensures Docker builds work with PR changes
- **Automated Comments**: Posts validation results directly on PRs

### üìä **Pipeline Status**

You can monitor the pipeline status:
- **GitHub Actions Tab**: View all workflow runs and their results
- **PR Comments**: Automated status updates on pull requests
- **Branch Protection**: Configure branch protection rules to require CI checks to pass
