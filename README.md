# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a simple fullstack task management application designed for internal team use. It allows you to create, view, delete, and update the status of tasks through a minimal, modern interface.

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Express, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Express** - Fast, unopinionated web framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).



## Project Structure

TaskFlow is structured as a monorepo to keep both the backend and frontend codebases in sync within a single repository. This approach provides several benefits:

âœ… Simplified dependency management â€“ everything lives under one package.json (or shared tooling when needed)

âœ… Easier development workflow â€“ no need to switch repos for fullstack work

âœ… Consistent tooling â€“ shared ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configs, etc.

âœ… Better collaboration â€“ clearer context when working on features that touch both API and UI

âœ… Unified CI/CD pipelines â€“ easier to test and deploy both layers together
